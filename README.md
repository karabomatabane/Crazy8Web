## Crazy 8 Card Game

### Overview

Welcome to the Crazy 8 Card Game! This project is a digital rendition of the popular card game widely enjoyed in South 
Africa. Built using `C#` with `.NET 7.0`, `Blazor Server`, `MatBlazor`, and `SignalR`, this game allows you to play 
Crazy 8 with friends regardless of geographical distances. I developed this game to reconnect and enjoy some fun times 
with my friends who live in different cities. I hope you find this project as exciting as I do. Contributions and 
collaborations are more than welcome!
